                            Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. 
                            While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, 
                            the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, 
                            a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, 
                            and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. 
                            Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. 
                            Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was
                            dominated by fishing or agriculture.
